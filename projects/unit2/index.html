            <p>I am building a tiny home on wheels and decided to make a floating wood floor and bed for my woodworking project
                (along with a few floating wine bottle holders with the scraps).
                The bed will be grounded to the wood floor. 
                I used 12mm Baltic Birch ply, 1"x1" poplar on the sides to add support, aluminum angles to ground the bed
                and rivet nuts to attach ply to the wall as a ground for the bed and future elements, like panels. The floor is made in three pieces 
                and held together by a 1 inch aluminum flat.

            <p>What I learned, or was reminded, from the process:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to use my measuring tape and blue tape to accurately estimate how much plywood I need to build.
                    Furniture grade wood was one of the biggest expenses. However, there are less measuring errors made when working 
                    with material of the same thickness, which saves time and money, especially for a new van builder. 
                    Also, the 1/2 ply furniture and struts will be lighter 
                    than 2x4 frames and 3/4" ply from Home Depot (which would be more money and of poor quality). 
                    The weigh reduction is going to 
                    save me money in gas while putting less of a strain on the engine. 
                </li>
                </br>
                <br>
                <li>How to make templates from scratch using brown paper and strong magnets instead of tape.
                    How to work with large templates that come with the van, like the floor mat to save loads of time 
                    and ensure accuracy.
                </li>
                </br>
                <br>
                <li>How to create a center line to plan my entire layout using a measuring tape, a right angle, a straight edge, 
                    and blue tape.
                </li> 
                    <p><img src="project-images/IMG_1608.JPG"alt="measure" style="width:400px"></p>

                <br></br>
                <li>Woodwork and Metalwork go hand in hand in van builds. This is a house that will move, 
                    vibrate and dance across hundreds of thousands of miles over the years. For example,
                     I installed rivet nuts which are used to ancor the furniture to the van in a variety of ways.
                </li>

                <br></br>
                <li> Routed the edge of the floor and joined the pieces with aluminum flats I cut to length with a chop saw.

                <p><li>Wheel well spacing needed to be modified a few times to compensate for wire feeds
                    I would have to manage later on. Also to move the bed towards the back of the van later on.
                    Sneaked up on it so I did't take too much off and would use a hole saw next time for the wire feed.
                </li></p>

                <br></br>
                <p><li>The two pieces of 1/2" ply make up the 1" necessary to hold a 1"x1/2" 
                    hard wood edge for the hinge. A hinge drilled directly into the middle of 1/2" 
                    wouldn't be a strong hold and would split. Note that this has to be accounted 
                    for in the plywood cuts that make up the two pieces that make the bed boxes lids.

                <li>
                    <p>Finding creative ways to problem solve mistakes is where most new skills were developed.
                    </p>
                    For example:
                    <br></br> If I strip a riv nut, I had to learn the skill of tapping new threads or removing a riv nut which sucks.
                     Also, I ended up getting plusnuts and cutting my losses with riv nuts. Riv nuts are cheaper but end up spinning 
                     and plusnut have more surface area so hold better over the long run. Here's a good article on the subject:
                     <p><a href="https://faroutride.com/crossnut/">Here's a good article on the subject!</a></p>
                    <br></br>The bed ended up being to far forward, so I learned how to scribe along the back of the 
                    van and make modifications on the bed to push it backwards 4 inches on both sides. 4 inches
                    is a tremendous waste of cubic space in a micro home like this. 
                <p><img src="project-images/IMG_.JPG"alt="add photo later" style="width:400px"></p>
                <p><img src="project-images/IMG_.JPG"alt="add photo later" style="width:400px"></p>
                    The table for the dinette/bed, which I decided to do in a beefer 3/4" ply, 
                    was heavy and combersome, so I decided to cut it down to an easy to manage size while using the other piece
                    as the top to a box storage seat I made a few months later. Note that the lip that
                    holds the table has to account for the 3/4" so the table is flush with the top of the
                    lids of the bed boxes.
