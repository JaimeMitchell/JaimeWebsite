            <!-- Start here -->

            <p> I am building a tiny home on wheels and decided to make a floating wood floor and bed for this unit project.
                The bed will be grounded to the wood floor. I'm building the entire van with 12mm Baltic Birch ply and aluminum 
                angles to ground the furniture. 
                <p>
                    What I learned from the process (or was reminded of):
                <ul>
                    <p>
                <li>How to use my measuring tape and blue tape to accurately estimate how much plywood I need to build.
                    <p>
                <li>How to make templates from scratch using brown paper and strong magnets instead of tape.
                    How to work with large templates that come with the van, like the floor mat.
                    
                    <p>
                <li>How to create a center line to plan my entire layout. </li> 
                    <p>
                <li>Skipping the step of using blue tape to visually map out my build will absolutely lead to mistakes. 
                    Conceptual measurements are not enough. They never account for things one may not think about 
                    Such as ignoring corners in the van that would cost one precious space.
                    <p>
                         FAIL! ðŸ˜¦ 
                        </p><img src="project-images/IMG_1457.JPG"alt="fail" style="width:800px"></a>
                        <p>SUCCESS! ðŸ˜Š
                        </p>
                        <img src="project-images/IMG_1459.JPG"alt="success" style="width:800px"></a>
                <li>Woodwork and Metalwork go hand in hand in van builds. This is a house that will move, 
                    vibrate and dance across hundreds of thousands of miles over the years. 
                    My bed is supported by installing aluminum angles between the floor and furniture.
            
                    and rivet nuts I installed, which are used to ancor the furniture in a variety of ways.
                   <p>
                <li>Finding creative ways to fix them is where skill is developed. For example, If I strip a rivet nut, I have to learn the skill of tapping new threads.
