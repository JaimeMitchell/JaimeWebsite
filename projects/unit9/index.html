            <p>This was a really hard unit for me. I figured all the thousands of hours over a 20+ years working on the Adobe Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, AfterEffects, etc...), would have prepared me for computer assisted 3D design via Fusion 360. Nope.
                This was by far the least intuitive and most complicated program I've ever touched. But then again, I know I felt this confused and frustrated when I first entered the world of Adobe for the first time, in 1997. In fact,
            computer assisted design was so weird to me as a teenage artist who was barely exposed to the recent birth of a WWW world, that I remained a ludite until 2004. Now this method of art and design is one of my oldest and dearest friends. 
            I kept this memory at the forefront to help me stay committed to learning this program and not giving up, no matter how hard it is. I know this page isn't going to have the eye candy and awesome 3D printed gadgetry I dream of making, 
            but I decided I wanted to spend the two weeks learning how to use the program, because once I have a good handle of the basics, I'll have the ability to design and make anything I can conjour up. 
            I did get some practice on the Prusa 3D printer and made a stand that was originally for a phone, but actually works
    way better as an air plant stand. Though this was the hardest unit I've experienced, it was also the one that required me to stretch my thinking and imagiination in terms of visualizing kerfs, tolerances between pieces in order to make them fit,
how to use what I know about 2D design, sculpting and coding parameters to move through this design process</p>

     <p>Here are my learning resources. Corey made a few sweet tutorials which were super helpful and answered a lot of questions and challenges I had with the programm as a beginner.</p>
