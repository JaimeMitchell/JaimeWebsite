            <p>My only website building experience was Wix and Coroflot. After putting it off for about 20 years I finally built a website 
                with HTML and CSS this week.
                I also tried my hand at Wordpress. 
                <p>What I learned:
                <ul>
                <li>I found HTML & CSS less frustrating and easy to problem solve through than WordPress or Wix. 
                    Itâ€™s consistent and does exactly what I tell it to, so the mistakes tend to be mine, 
                    such as linking or pointing to files incorrectly (as shown below).
                <p>
                <li>FAIL! ðŸ˜¦ 
                   </p><img src="project-images/IMG_1457.JPG"alt="fail" style="width:800px"></a>
        <p>SUCCESS! ðŸ˜Š
        </p>
            <img src="project-images/IMG_1459.JPG"alt="success" style="width:800px"></a>

        <li>With WordPress/Wix I found it to be harder to move layout around and navigate basic controls, but easier to make it look pretty.
       <p></p>
            <li>Any failure to make things work was mainly from their clunky, buggy, difficult interface, or the withholding of features unless I pay to play.
        </li>

         <li>Wix is my preferred site if Iâ€™m going the point/click/drag/waste money route. It helped me get my feet wet in web design, <a href='https://jaimemitchell100.wixsite.com/jaime100'target="_blank">shown here.</a>
         <p><li>Going on youtube to watch tutorials, visiting W3schools.com and spending an hour getting coached by the program's instructor, Corey Rice, helped build on my DIY confidence.</ul></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Git and Github had been something I've had a 10 minute previous experience with. 
        As part of my Corona lock down I bought a Raspberry Pi and Elegoo set (Arduino kit knockoff),
        joined a free online class (CS50) to learn more about computer science.
    </p>

    <p>The class required Github to turn in assignments but I didn't really get git's gest.
        Not until last week, when the desktop I was using for this website died in it's sleep. The one 
        time in 15 years I didn't back up my work compulsively...

    <p>What I learned in the process:
    <ul>
        <li>When the desktop died the Raspberry pi took over the project.
            I found a knockoff version of Visual Studio Code for the Pi <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://code.headmelted.com" target="_blank"><b>here.</b></a></p>
        <p>
        <li>A repository is the folder of my website's code</li>
        <p>
        <li>Git automatically takes snapshots of everything I do to my repositoy, 
            like a spy tracking my every move.
            Or like Adobe Lightroom's history.
            <p>
        <li>I have to have my files in the correct location (the Pi Home folder for me) 
            then initialize Git to that folder.
            If Git can't see the file clearly it will ignore me and tell me I'm making 
            fatal errors which felt a little passive
            aggresive...
            <p>
    <li>This happened because I tried to set up Git with SSH on my Pi, and that didn't go over well 
        because I didn't understand
        how to use either Git or SSH. ...Baby steps... ðŸ˜¦ 
    <p><img src='project-images/git3.jpg' alt=":(" style="width:800px"></a>
    <p><img src='project-images/git1.jpg' alt=":(" style="width:800px"></a>
     The correct place to initialize Git! ðŸ˜Š<p><img src='project-images/gitjaime.jpg' alt="fail" 
        style="width:400px"></a>
        <p>Corey showed me how to use SSH, seperate from Git, to control a "headless" Pi. 
            <img src="project-images/sshcorey.jpg"alt="success" style="width:800px"></a>
        <li>Once Git's set up to Github, the "remote" repository, I need to tell Git when I want to 
            commit any changes to my remote repository (Github) from the local repository (Rasperry pi).   </li>
            <p>
        <li>Github stores the repository in the sky above like a little colicky cherub angel that 
            takes time to respond. Hard refreshes, 5 minutes of patience, and walking away works.</li>
            <p>
        <li>Umm, I have to save before I can even think about adding and committing changes to my Repository. 
        <p>
            <li>Then Git needs to be spoken to like a puppy in the Command Line. The tone should be direct, sequential and 
                simple. "git add. git commit -m ("comment"). git push origin main..."
            
        <p>Ctrl+S! You know this... ðŸ˜¦ 
       <img src="project-images/git2.jpg"alt=":(" style="width:800px"></a>
       
       <p><li>As a last step, I have to enter my user name and password everytime, which is a bit tedious for 2020. 
           There's a quicker way to push through the front door with Shelly's secret handshake (SSH). 
           I'll attempt that next week and save/add/commit/push that process here.
       <img src="project-images/git5.jpg"alt=":)" style="width:800px"></a>
       <p>
        <li>I also learned commands that help me keep track of what I'm doing such as "git status"&"git log".
            <p>...with the added bonus of learning how to take a screenshot in terminal. 
                As you can see, the screenshot is unreadable (unless opened in a new window), I can't control
                where terminal takes the screenshot, so I'm going to figure out the GUI-way when time permits.
            </p>
