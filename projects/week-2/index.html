            <p>Git and Github had been something I've had a 10 minute experience. 
                As part of my Corona lock down I bought a Raspberry Pi and Elegoo set (Arduino kit knockoff)
                I joined a free online class (CS50) to learn more about computer science in order 
                to understand embedded coding a bit more.
            </p>

            <p>The class required Github to turn in assignments but I still didn't really get what git was for.
                Not until last week, when the desktop I was using died on me during my website project. The one 
                time in 15 years I didn't back up my work...
        
            <p>What I learned in the process:
            <ul>
                <li>When the desktop died the Raspberry pi took over. I found a knockoff version of Visual Studio Code for the Pi <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://code.headmelted.com" target="_blank"><b>here.</b></a></p>
                <p>
                <li>A repository is the folder of my website's code</li>
                <p>
                <li>Git automatically takes snapshots of everything I do to my repositoy, like a spy tracking my every move.
                    Or like history in Adobe Lightroom.
                    <p>
                <li>Git needs to be spoken to in the Command Line. The tone should be direct, sequential and simple as if speaking 
                    to a puppy. "git add. git commit -m ("comment"). git push origin master..."
                    <p>
                <li>I have to have my files in the correct location (the Pi Home folder for me) then initialize Git to that folder.
                    If Git can't see the file clearly it will ignore me and tell me I'm making fatal errors which felt a little passive
                    aggresive...
                    <p>
            <li>I tried to learn about SSH and Git simultaneously and that didn't go over well with Git either. ðŸ˜¦ 
            <p><img src='project-images/git3.jpg' alt=":(" style="width:800px"></a>
            <p><img src='project-images/git1.jpg' alt=":(" style="width:800px"></a>
             The correct place to initialize Git! ðŸ˜Š<p><img src='project-images/gitjaime.jpg' alt="fail" style="width:400px"></a>
                <p>Corey showed me some SSH seperate from Git and I controlled a "headless" Pi with baby steps. 
                    <img src="project-images/sshcorey.jpg"alt="success" style="width:800px"></a>
                <li>Once Git's set up to Github, the "remote" repository, I need to tell Git when I want to commit any changes to my 
                    remote repository (Github) from the local repository (Rasperry pi).   </li>
                    <p>
                <li>Github stores the repository in the sky above like a little colicky cherub angel that takes time to respond. 
                    Hard refreshes and 5 minutes of patience and walking away works.</li>
                    <p>
                <li>umm, I have to save before I can even think about adding and committing change. 
                    So basically I have to save, add, commit, push to github and enter my user name and password everytime 
                    (I'm sure there's a quicker way to push through the door by a secret handshake, but I'm not there yet)
                <p>Ctrl+S! You know this... ðŸ˜¦ 
               <img src="project-images/git2.jpg"alt="fail" style="width:800px"></a>
               <p>This is the path to take. It's not straight-forward, but it worked.</p>
