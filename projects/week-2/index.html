            <p>Git and Github had been something I've had some experience with over the past 6 months. 
                As part of my Corona lock down I bought a Raspberry Pi and Elegoo set (Arduino kit knockoff)
                and joined an EdX class called CS50 to learn more about C, Command line and Python in order 
                to really understand embedded code and not just copy and paste it.
                CS50 required joining Github and I succeed in setting up an account and using it to send my 
                finished assignments in, but didn't understand what the rest of github was actually for.
                Not until I had the old desktop I was using die on me during my website build last week.
                I had backed up my work on google drive but that was an older version, so the ability to have
                a program (git) that saves every move I make on a cloudbased platform (Github), became paramount 
                to keeping accurate and automatically updated documentation of my fabrication work in this program,
                while also hosting my website for free and allowing my instructors to help me remotely.
        
                <p>What I learned:
                <ul>
                <li>A repository is the folder of my website's code</li>
                <li>Git automatically takes snapshots of everything I do to my repositoy, like a spy tracking my every move.
                <li>Git needs to be spoken to in the Command Line. The tone should be direct, sequential and patient,
                such as,"git do this thing. git do this thing. git do this thing.</li>".
                <li>I have to have my files in the correct location, pi folder for me, and then initialize Git to that folder.
                    If Git can't see the file clearly it will ignore me and tell me I'm making fatal errors which felt a little
                over-the-top and hostile, but I understand git was born in 2005, is a teenager, so we just needed to have established
            boundaries, and that's my job by making the path to my repository clear and not in a folder in a folder in a folder. 
                <li>Once it's set up to github as the "remote" location I need to tell it when I want to commit any changes to my Repository.   </li>
                <li>Github stores the repository in the sky above like a little colicky cherub angel that takes time to respond. Hard refreshes and patience works.</li>
                <li>   
                <p>
                <li>FAIL! ðŸ˜¦ 
                   </p><img src="project-images/IMG_1457.JPG"alt="fail" style="width:800px"></a>
        <p>SUCCESS! ðŸ˜Š
        </p>
            <img src="project-images/IMG_1459.JPG"alt="success" style="width:800px"></a>

        <li>With WordPress/Wix I found it to be harder to move layout around and navigate basic controls, but easier to make it look pretty.
       <p></p>
            <li>Any failure to make things work was mainly from their clunky, buggy, difficult interface, or the withholding of features unless I pay to play.
        </li>

         <li>Wix is my preferred site if Iâ€™m going the point/click/drag/waste money route. It helped me get my feet wet in web design, <a href='https://jaimemitchell100.wixsite.com/jaime100'target="_blank">shown here.</a>
         <p><li>Going on youtube to watch tutorials, visiting W3schools.com and spending an hour getting coached by the program's instructor, Corey Rice, helped build on my DIY confidence.</ul></p>
