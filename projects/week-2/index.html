            <p>Git and Github had been something I've had some experience with over the past 6 months. 
                As part of my Corona lock down I bought a Raspberry Pi and Elegoo set (Arduino kit knockoff)
                and joined a free EdX class called CS50 to learn more about C, Command line and Python in order 
                to really understand embedded code to create electronic projects, and not just copy and paste it.
                
            <p>CS50 required joining Github and I succeed in setting up an account and using it to send my 
                finished assignments in, but didn't understand what the rest of github was actually for.</p>

            <p>Not until I had the old desktop I was using die on me during my website build last week.
                I had backed up my work on google drive but that was an older version, so the ability to have
                a program (git) that saves every move I make on a cloudbased platform (Github), became paramount 
                in keeping accurate and automatically updated documentation of my fabrication work in this program,
            <p>Github also hosts my website for free.
        
            <p>What I learned in the process:
            <ul>
                <li>When the desktop died the Raspberry pi took over. I found a knockoff version of Visual Studio Code for the Pi <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://code.headmelted.com" target="_blank"><b>here.</b></a></p>
                </li><p>
                <li>A repository is the folder of my website's code</li>
                <p> <p><img src='project-images/gitjaime.jpg' alt="fail" style="width:400px"></a>
                <li>Git automatically takes snapshots of everything I do to my repositoy, like a spy tracking my every move.
                <li>Git needs to be spoken to in the Command Line. The tone should be direct, sequential and simple as if speaking 
                    to a dog. "git add. git commit. git push. git origin master...</li>".
                <li>I have to have my files in the correct location, pi folder for me, and then initialize Git to that folder.
                    If Git can't see the file clearly it will ignore me and tell me I'm making fatal errors which felt a little
                over-the-top and hostile, but I understand git was born in 2005, is a teenager, so we just needed to have established
            boundaries, and that's my job by making the path to my repository clear and not in a folder in a folder in a folder. 
            <li>FAIL! ðŸ˜¦ 
            <p><img src='project-images/git1.jpg' alt="fail" style="width:800px"></a>
                <li>Once git's set up to github, the "remote" repository, I need to tell git when I want to commit any changes to my 
                    Github Repository from the local repository in my Rasperry pi.   </li>
                <li>Github stores the repository in the sky above like a little colicky cherub angel that takes time to respond. 
                    Hard refreshes and patience works.</li>
                <li>umm, I have to hit save before I can even think about adding and committing a change. 
                    So basically I have to save, add, commit, push to github and enter my user name and password everytime 
                    (I'm sure there's a quicker way to push through the door by a secret handshake, but I'm not there yet)
                <p> <li>FAIL! ðŸ˜¦ 
                </p><p><img src="project-images/git2.jpg"alt="fail" style="width:800px"></a>

                <p>SUCCESS! ðŸ˜Š
                <img src="project-images/sshcorey.jpg"alt="success" style="width:800px"></a>
