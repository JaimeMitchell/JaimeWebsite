            <p>I wanted a little more practice with soldering and found a kit at MakeHaven collecting some dust. This is the result. I'd say put it on mute but that would defeat the purpose of the obnoxious sounding Atari Punk Console Alien's existenced. It's banchee-like squeals let me know I soldered it together correctly.

                Include vid of van electronics completed this week.
            </P>
            A family member wanted their vacuum fixed and had it misdiagnosed by a local appliance repair shop. They said it needed a new motor which cost more than the actual vaccuum cost, so I opened it up, drained the capicitors of their stored energy, and went to work on it. 
            The motor is perfect and needs no repair. It does need a new cord reel assembly, but I cleaned up and refitted some loose and dirty connections and have it working until we can replace that component that is actually broken. 
            The family member is going back to that guy to get the diagnoses fee he charged back. He either tried to rip her off, or just didn't want to diagnose it 
            accurately. It felt good to use what I've learned to fix common household appliances, know enough now about electronics and mechanics to at least know if a guy is trying to rip off me or someone I care about,
            and I enjoyed seeing how happy it made the person to save a lot of money and have something they value working again without having to add trash to the landscape or buy more sh!t.
