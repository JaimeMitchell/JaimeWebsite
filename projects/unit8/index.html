           <p> The huge project of this unit was installing an electric system in my home.
            The most challenging aspects of the process were:</p>

            <li>Fitting all the componenets in a small space while insuring adequate clearance. 
            For instance, the solar charge controler needs 6 inches to vent heat properly, and the DC to DC Charger needed 4 inches.
            I am not totally happy with the end result and think I'm going to change it to put the fuse block and common bus bar next 
        in the middle so the cable runs are shorter.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The wiring...No, actually the cabling. The cables to connect the 3 batteries in parellel are 4/0. Pair that with 
            my inexperience in sizing, cutting, stripping the insulation off just enough without cutting the wire strands off, and crimping something that thick and rigid was a bit stressful. That cable wasn't cheap and I took a lot of time making sure I didn't waste the wire or the lugs by careless mistakes and thankfully I 
            didn't make too many miscalculations. As far as I can tell, everything works as it should.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Phantom Power. There is 3-4watts (.5 amps) of phantom power being wasted. I turned the switches off on EVERYTHING; the fuse block, the charge controlers, etc., but the phantom remains. I may need to recalibrate the battery monitor, so this is on the todo list. 
            The battery monitor didn't turn on at first which is shown on one of the videos. I originally didn't connect it correctly due to taking bad advice from a "pro" who said to disregard the red cables that go to positive, 
            ignore the manual and just hook the shunt to the negative side. 
            They said the red wires that came with it were only for temperature reads, which isn't needed with lithium batteries. That's actually not the only thing those wires are for and it was a reminder to not listen to people and just follow my gut, 
            and the manual. This way if anything goes wrong, I can have the company correct their mistake, whereas if I take some "professionals" advice, I am not insured any help from the company if I f*ck up their unit. The shunt goes to the 
            negative side, this is true, but the monitor absolutely needs to be connected to the positive side with the wiring it comes with that are for both temperture reads AND a source of power for the monitor to turn on. Duh.  
            Two wires come with it, which is awesome because I can hook it up to monitor my starter/vehincle battery, which is pretty sweet. I want to keep that thing healthy and happy.

    </p><br> <li> Many YouTube "infuencers" are actually newbies like me, NOT PROFESSIONALS, and often do very dangerous shit with their electrical systems while pushing product and speaking as if they know what the fuck they are talking about. 
           Examples are, They don't give enough clearance to the chargers or inverter, or even their heaters. They ground to chassis in multiple places, which could cause more problems.
           For instance, people who have a DC to DC charger like me will not consider that the negative cable leading from the starter battery is directly connected to the "factory ground". 
           This is the one chassis ground you really can trust and which ties the electric system to a common ground.
            I didn't make any move to turn my system on until I was absolutely, 100% sure about grounding my system properly. 
            There isn't a true ground, or Earth, in a vehicle. The inherent nature of a moving home and rubber tires raising it from the earth, are the obvious reasons. 
            And when you introduce an inverter for AC, or solar panels that could get hit with lightening, 
            things get more complicated and I'm still confused about some of it to tell you the truth. Hopefully this confusion will be erased from the website as I move through the program.

            I've also been studying about the basic logic that is the literal gateways to electricity and every electric appliance we use. A lot of this also translate to logic in embedded coding. What better way to learn logic than building it with my hands.

               I wanted a little more practice soldering. After Corey gave me a few 1-on-1 lessons, I found a kit at MakeHaven collecting some dust. This is the result. I'd say put it on mute but that would take away this electric creature's purpose in life. It's banchee-like squeals let me know I soldered it together correctly.

            A family member wanted their vacuum fixed and had it misdiagnosed by a local appliance repair shop. They said it needed a new motor which cost more than the actual vaccuum cost, so I opened it up, drained the capicitors of their stored energy, and went to work on it. 
            The motor is perfect and needs no repair. It does need a new cord reel assembly, but I cleaned up and refitted some loose and dirty connections and have it working until we can replace that component that is actually broken. 
            The family member is going back to get refunded the diagnoses fee from that guy. He either tried to rip her off, or just didn't want to take the time to diagnose it 
            accurately. I think he did both. It felt good to use what I've learned to fix common household appliances, know enough now about electronics & mechanics to at least know if a guy is full of shit,
            plus I really enjoyed seeing how happy it made her, to save a lot of money and have something they value working again without having to add trash to the landscape or buy more crap, when the old crap works just fine if not better than things that 
            have product obsolesence built into them.
