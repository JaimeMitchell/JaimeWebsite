            <p>I started this unit a week early by collaborating with my instructor, Corey Rice, on a project for a dust shoe he was printing. 
                He wanted to add the MakeHaven Robot and I accepted the challenge. I hadn't touched Adobe Illustrator in a few years and needed
                the refresher. Here's the results.
            </p>
            
            <br>After that I took off. I felt pretty comfortable with all the software being used, and picking up the quarks of the laser cutter, felt 
            fairly intuitive and easy to problem solve through with some advice from a classmate who had been using it for awhile.
            I did a combination of laser cutting my photos on scrap wood, and printing objects I needed for my van build, such as custom vents for the electronics system
            I'm installing next week.
            With the photos I had a lot of fun playing around with the settings, trying out different methods, such as using a stroke 
            outline and vector cutting, or using a more photorealistic method of raster printing. It kind of felt like being in a dark room where I didn't 
            get instant feedback from the software on how the end result would turn out, but had to patiently wait to see what magic would appear before my eyes.

            <br>Here are images and video of my vent design for the van builds electronics compartment. 
            I didn't want to buy a plastic or metal lourve, 
            and prefered to design the exact size I wanted with a minimalist aesthetic. 
            I enjoy a more colorful and interesting look,
            but a small living space can get cluttered and chaotic quickly, and my head has a lot going on, 
            so I keep my habitat as simple/boring in appearance as possible. This may change down the line.
            I faux painted a few of the vents to give the appearance of copper covered with turquise patina.
